# findYourHat

## Overview

In this project, I built an interactive terminal game. The scenario is that the player has lost their hat in a field full of holes, and they must navigate back to it without falling down one of the holes or stepping outside of the field.

### Details
* generates a random map
* add randomized start and end nodes
* I also added A* pathfinding as an extra; not perfect, not the most efficient, but it finds a way!
