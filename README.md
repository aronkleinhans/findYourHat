# findYourHat
Another codecademy project!

## Overview

"In this project, youâ€™ll be building an interactive terminal game. The scenario is that the player has lost their hat in a field full of holes, and they must navigate back to it without falling down one of the holes or stepping outside of the field."

### Details
* generates a random map
* add randomized start and end nodes
* I also added A* pathfinding as an extra; not perfect, not the most efficient, but it finds a way!

(it was hard, but rewarding)
